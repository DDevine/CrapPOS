Bugs:
	Scanners were not closed when loading databases
	Data stored in files with double dashes (--) will cause data inconsistency
	The menu had a price field, this was a design fault
	The running total for the day is not required, it can be worked out upon request. (This can be done for any date)
	Entering an invalid option at the menu crashed the program
	Removed display() function from Main
	
Scanner resource leak:
The scanner was not closed, and this caused a resource leak in the program when starting up.  However,
if the size of the customers and menu files were small this is negligible.

Data corruption:
Fields which may be entered by a user (Such as password, address and customer names) and saved to
disk may not contain double dashes (--). If these are contained, then the programs will not crash,
but will load data from disk inconsistently.

Menu price:
As per the design documentation, the Menu class initially had a floating point price field. This
field was not required, as the menu is not an item on the menu.

Running Total:
This was specified as required in the design documentation, however it can be avoided by totaling
all the orders for the given day. This is actually done by the Sales Report already, which avoids
the days total.

Menu Option Crash:
Entering an empty option at the submenus caused the program to crash with an exception. It has
since been fixed.

Display Function Removed:
The display function was removed from the Main class, as the implementation was downsized from
a graphical swing interface to a text based command line interface.
