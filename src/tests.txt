Bugs:
	Scanners were not closed when loading databases
	Data stored in files with double dashes (--) will cause data inconsistency
	The menu had a price field, this was a design fault
	The running total for the day is not required, it can be worked out upon request. (This can be done for any date)
	
	
Scanner resource leak:
The scanner was not closed, and this caused a resource leak in the program when starting up.  However,
if the size of the customers and menu files were small this is negligible.

Data corruption:
Fields which may be entered by a user (Such as password, address and customer names) and saved to
disk may not contain double dashes (--). If these are contained, then the programs will not crash,
but will load data from disk inconsistently.

Menu price:
As per the design documentation, the Menu class initially had a floating point price field. This
field was not required, as the menu is not an item on the menu.
